# Calculating-Pi-using-Random-Numbers

I use the Basel Formula for Pi to calculate it. Euler discovered the fact that the probability of 2 random numbers being co-prime (i.e., having a common factor of only 1), is 6 / pi^2

Steps - 
1. Calculate 10,000 (or more) pairs of random numbers
2. Find out how many of them are co-prime
3. Divide the number of co-prime pairs by the total number of pairs
4. Calculate sqrt(6 / the_above_number)

This is our very rough estimate of Pi.

With 100,000 numbers, I got an estimate of Pi to be - 3.1415820198
